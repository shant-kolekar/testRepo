 "interview_question": "-How long between marriages was it just you, your sibling(s), and parent -Was your parent mentally or physically abusive -How long did your parent let the abuse go on -How did having an abusive parent make you feel -Who do you go to with your problems Their excuse for asking these questions, is because \"They promote so quickly internally, and you can become responsible for a lot of assets within the company quickly.\" they justify it by saying that \"The process has been used for over 20 years.\" I get it, they need to be thorough, they are a private company, they promote quickly- However it doesn't give them the right to make someone relive, in great detail, traumatic events. The fact that they disregard the possibility that their interview process may upset someone just because \"a decent amount\" do not fall into a \"victim\" category says to me that this is a company I wouldn't want to work for or support. I decided moments after the final interview process was over that I would not work for this company so when they called a few days later to tell me they had gone with someone else I was not offended by it at all. I explained my position that I would have turned them down regardless- There was no apology, just a defensive explanation, and the guy told me to call him if i needed a pillow or mattress... Which also makes me feel that these people are emotionally stunted as well, again supporting my decision to never support this company. Things are very different then they were 20 years ago, perhaps the interview process should be reevaluated."

They have a well defined process which basically includes a defined set of questions for each of these rounds. So, none of these interviewers actually have a conversation with you. They just ask you the question and keep noting down what you are speaking. It can very well be replaced by handing out a questionaire or a form to you. Surprisingly the final round with the CEO was also the same. He never looked up and had a real conversation with me while I was seating across the table and he kept asking one after the other set of questions he had and kept noting my answer; which felt very mechanical. Though the questions of the Technical round were really good and more suitable for the role. Questions asked by the CEO: Tell your 3 weaknessess Tell me what motivates you Tell me the hardest thing you had to do in Sales Tell me 3 things your customer says about you"

 "interview_question": "A few weeks after applying I was e-mailed with written questions which I promptly responded to. I then had a phone interview set up. This was 40-60mins and was thorough. After a few days of juggling with their schedule a full week later I was invited to a full interview. I also had to complete another hour of online personality quizzes and functional IQ tests via computer prior to the interview. The formal interview lasted FOUR HOURS! I was given a walking tour of the two office floors then lead to a small side room for the first of three stages of interviewing. There was a written portion on computer responding to a pretend customer complaint, another segment you will be handed a document detailing fictitious performance numbers on your 'team' and given time to take notes and prepare for how you would approach improvements, etc. Then a panel of three, in my case HR and two British team leads, join you in the room for over an hour of questioning and various scenarios to the point where each of them is completely exhausted and so done with the meeting too. I have been through numerous federal hiring systems for classified level positions that took less time than this. Half a day to handle an interview is ridiculous and reflects poorly on the company as a whole. I was there early in the week for my interview and told I would hear by Friday either way, two weeks later I finally received an e-mail. This approach leads to very serious questions again of how this company is managed overall if it takes up to five weeks to complete interviews with so many committed hours of badly designed interview processes it is a wonder they have any staff at all with the wasted hours of poorly conducted vetting. Needless to say I had already more than decided to apply my energies towards a better run company long before they finally got around to their final decision after the circus they drag applicants through."
