With all the best, Julia Q3 (Please reply to this question in an email format) - I have just registered but I am really confused as to how this all works? I want to pay the sum of \u20ac3,450 to a recipient's Danish bank account (i.e. this is the exact sum the recipient is due.)

When I use the example calculator it appears that the recipient will receive less than the exact required sum due to fee charges being deducted?

I can successfully purchase a plan via our website, and we do receive an email informing us about the order, but I can\u2019t keep on manually updating this in our system! Surely there is a way to do this automatically? What am I missing here? Also, on my test purchase, it came through on my bank statement as ***PADDLE.NET*** how do I change this to display BIGVOICE instead? This will really confuse our customers! This was supposed to be easy. Sincerely, Jesse Head of Product Big Voice\" Assignment 1 : Please write a sample response back.

I tried to better narrow down the problem with 5 or 6 questions as to if there were any error messages, or if they could better describe the problems they were having. Every response was vague, and I knew the point was not to solve the problem, but to test my comfort level in finding a resolution. After about 2 minutes of probing with questions, I deferred to transferring them to my support manager to better assist them. That's when the interviewer said, \"I'll hold ...\". Then, dead air for about 5 seconds. I broke character at that point, not knowing where to go from there. Did she expect me to come back on the line impersonating some fictitious support manager? I was baffled. I am still baffled, but now it makes me laugh. The interview was over shortly thereafter."

She summarized the responsibilities of the position and said that she felt I was overqualified for it. I told her that I had tried applying to a different position at SeedLegals that I felt fit my qualifications, but when I called and emailed the company to see if that position was still open, nobody answered, so I ended up applying to this position instead. She said okay and abruptly ended the Zoom call. From the very outset, she seemed totally disinterested in talking to me and clearly didn't take the time to read through my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 because she didn't even know where I was based. I have no idea why she chose to interview me when she knew that I wasn't a good fit for this role. This was definitely the strangest interview I've ever had and will not be interviewing with SeedLegals again in the future. Also, the company is disorganized. They don't answer calls or emails and the whole process of setting up the Zoom interview was more difficult than it needed to be."

And some example customer questions which you have to write a reply to: 1. I currently have a FREE Account Plan. My clients project is on hold but It's already on a site plan. If I cancel the site plan will it in some way be disabled? 2. Hey Webflow, I'm just confused about how to either have my client connect their credit card to their site plan directly or how I can connect my existing stripe account to do client billing. Could you also explain the Webflow platform fee? How much would my client be charged each month if they use the Monthly CMS Site Plan with a $10 profit amount? As a side note, am I correct in the understanding that if I have more than 2 sites on web flow that I also have to sign up for an account plan? 3. Hi, I just received my credit card statement and i was double charged for $192! I only have one project with an Webflow and it is on a CMS Site Plan.

The old version worked fine, but now I can\u2019t use the extension in Firefox at all, nothing happens when I click on it. I tried reinstalling the extension, but no luck. The old version didn\u2019t have this problem. Shouldn\u2019t the new one work better than the old one? How do I get it working? - Howdy! I have 1Password 3 on my iPhone and I\u2019d like to update without losing all of my logins. What do I do? - WTF every time I update, your stupid software disappears. You have my data held hostage and I can't get into any of my important web sites. YOU NEED TO FIX THIS RIGHT AWAY. - Wie f\u00fcge ich weitere Team-Mitglieder zu einem Tresor?"
