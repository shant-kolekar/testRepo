He had seen my resume online...brings me in and tells me, given my resume and experience (which I am more than aware of), he would rather put me in a marketing position. Something I've been very successful in for 30 years (I was just looking for a semi-retirement mindless job)...so then he wanted me to apply my many years of marketing knowledge. As I told him, \"That's a whole different ball game than being a personal assistant.\" He sends me an offer letter with a title below any I have ever held, even out of college with a salary less than the personal assistant job...something I had not made since 1984. SURELY YOU JEST!! The pompous arrogance is unbelievable. I countered with two offers and he just never returned my call and that was the end of that. How immature these arrogant people are and trust me, the arrogance is completely unfounded. I would stay away. I should have taken heed of the previous Glassdoor comments. I did take note before going in as to how low his CEO rating was and, it is even lower in my opinion. The second I walked in, he spouts out some negative comment about the great GPS system I used to find his office (which he said people have a hard time finding.) I didn't. He then proceeds to bash two of his current employees. He has no business working with people or making job offers. He is obviously just plain greedy and clueless. Most people who exude such arrogance are just negative, insecure people on power trips and the describes the CEO of Big Red, in my opinion. DO NOT WORK HERE!!"

 "interview_question": "Very disappointing. The role I applied for focused on heavy recruiting and heavy employee relations, which is what my strengths are in. I went straight to onsite to speak with 2 members of the NY Corporate team. Mid-interview, I found out (through a question) that the role had changed and the big focus was on Benefits, NOT ER. While I do have benefits experience, I wish this was communicated with me prior to coming in. If there was an update in current business needs, it's imperative to update job descriptions that are affected and inform candidates prior to speaking with them. This way you would find out if they are still interested. To be honest, I wouldn't have applied as my interests/strengths aren't in Benefits and it would have saved a lot of their time. Also, on your website, it still says Resourcing and HR Advisor, which is incorrect. The interviewers spoke about transparency being important to the company, maybe be transparent to candidates before they take time out of their work day to interview. Another point made was branding being hard to achieve in NY. This experience doesn't help your branding - looks like there are kinks internally that need to be fixed first. With the NY office growing, obtaining and retaining top talent is important and hard. Unfortunately, you lost someone who could help you grow and achieve those results."
