Don't do what I did and start throwing facts and figures at them. Establish their market and strategy first and apply the facts accordingly. Who is their ideal customer (holiday makers or corporate), what is their main focus (filled rooms of just mere footfall). I couldn't stop talking (and this is why I wasn't hired).

Then I was told by the very same internal recruiter that another Account Manager role had become available in a different division in the same office location and that because I had such a great interview previously that they were actively looking to hire me as an Account Manager. Thus, I went to meet a different VP who stated that we were not discussing the Account Manager role whatsoever and that they were looking for an appointment booker in a junior role. The VP told me he was surprised I would even consider such a role and when I told him that I was there to interview for the Account Manager's role with his team. He stated that no such role existed and expressed to me his anger with the internal recruiter and apologized to me."

I mentioned room for growth. They questioned what I meant by \"room for growth\" within a company. Reasonable question. I mentioned promotions, recognition for work. I was then questioned with what I meant by \"promotions.\" I did not know how to answer an answer that didn't need to be discussed further. They then asked what I knew about the company. I told them everything I knew. They were upset I didn't know more. Told me not to ask about what they do if all of it was available on the internet. They eventually told me I was wasting their time so I walked out. They never discussed what the position entailed or what the company does that I might have missed. Before I walked out, I was scolded and told they pay 90% of benefits, pay $15 an hour, and have a kitchen full of alcohol and food. That is all I ever learned."

How about we set an appointment for tomorrow?\" Tomorrow came and the appointment was pushed back because XYZ was busy. Same with the next day and the next. Then it all went dark. No further contact. From the outside looking in, 180Fusion appears to have it together and very capable. From the inside looking out, it was a mess. While waiting for an interview I was within a couple of feet (no wall separating us) from a manager chewing out an employee for bad language and mistreating another employee. Fair enough other than the manager was choosing equally poor words and was clearly uncomfortable, causing an unprofessional conversation. Additionally, why was this happening in large glass foyer where anyone within 50' could hear the dressing-down?"

His range was $13-$16 budgeted. I told him I was negotiable. I wonder If I was not considered because of the BLS wage/salary trend range.."

I had asked what the scenario was, the manager explained that he could get the same vehicle 2000 dollars cheaper from a different place but the question was why would I want to buy from you. so I naturally gave my first response on how I would sell anything, within 6 to 7 seconds he clapped his hands and said to stop and that I had nailed the question right on the head. I also had a lot of questions for the two people who interviewed me because this was a total curveball and was not expecting this so I ask my questions and really explained what I was about and what my goals were as a person and for this company and that's why I got hired with no beverage experience, it is because I am very good at all other aspects of communication and sales"

If you are a teenager, be prepared to be asked for either your high school diploma or a expected date of completion, and then be told they would just LOVE to have you came back in a year or two and work for them.
