(NOTE: I danced around giving a firm answer as best as I could, but the interviewers forced me to give an answer...my advice is, regardless of what your answer to tough questions may be if interviewing w/ Epic, just give one. You'll be forced to one anyways, delaying it makes you look weak and indecisive.)"

Then he started talking about offering shares in the company. It was totally wrong. Questions included: Tell me about a time when you had to jump through hoops that were not originally in your scope of expectation and what you did to deal with it. What did you do when you've had to deal with a customer who is demanding and was difficult to deal with? How did you deal with conflict in direction? Now these may not be the exact words that their manager used, but they hit the points he wanted from me. Remember that he never showed interest in who I am, what I've done and even after learning that I am a published author of three books, he was absolutely lost in his own mind so.......... Might these questions show any perspective hire just what a difficulty it might be working under his supervision?"

 "interview_question": "This place is a SCAM. I applied for the 'marketing associate role,' and got a call saying I had been shortlisted for an interview. I asked the recruiter which role I was being considered for, and she told me I was being considered for the ' account executive' role. I was confused at this point since I didn't even apply to this role. I told the recruiter I wasn't interested in a sales role, I wanted to do marketing, and she assured me it would be 80 percent marketing. I went in for an interview, and the office was almost bare empty and looked like they just moved in. After asking several questions, the man whom I interviewed with told me I was being considered for the 'Management Trainee' role. This was now the third different role they told me I was being considered for, NONE of which I even applied for. I asked him what the salary would be and he told me that it was \"competitive,\" and I would learn more in the second interview. For the second interview, the woman interviewing explained thier 'training process.' She pointed to a flow chart, titled 'Executive Training Program'-- where the jobs listed ' account executive, account manager, junior executive, and senior executive,' with corresponding lengths for each role. She told me the first 2 (account executive, account manager) take up to 6 months before you can advance. I asked her about compensation for each of those two roles, to which she responded 400- 500 a month. I asked her if that was on top of commission-- and she responded that they ONLY do commission. NO BASE SALARY!!!! I was shocked because at this point, I had not only been lured into an office in which a job title I applied for didn't exist, they are totally untransparent about their roles AND their \"competitive salary. \""

A time when you wanted to do things differently than the others. Questions on why working in digital marketing, for essence, about what you learnt during your studies and might ask directly about some work experience they see in your cv. Lots of time allocated if you have questions. They also tell you about the role. About the case studies, they said I did not have to practice and could not give any example, but you CAN practice ! I had been doing this more generally for management consulting and they were exactly the same type of case study questions (you can find books or Uni societies who can help); they were just like the easy level of case study. You are given a business scenario and asked 4-5 questions (calculate the profite made over the first year of openning a new shop; what would you advise if you can only make a new website or a new shop (here you calculate profitability again (easy, just like profit= revenue - costs), and the two other questions are verbal, see if you can be creative)."

It then followed that a software company could generate a highe r conv rate but there would be a drop in users annually. I then had to work out the new commission value, minus software cost and user drop. I'm ok at maths but this threw me and I crumbled during this process and I believe it's what lost me the role.

M was abrasive and made me really consider if I should take the job as she was full of red flags. Ultimately instinct was correct and I left because of her micro-managing, hierarchal approach. She is not an expert or qualified to manage a person with more than a years experience in this field. She has an MBA and feels it makes her more knowledgeable than a seasoned sales person with 6 years experience. A shame because everyone else is strong. One of those people you run from after trying every way to work with them but you realize they will never change or compromise."
