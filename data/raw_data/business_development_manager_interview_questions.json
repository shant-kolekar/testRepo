You're not European, you're not an engineer, and we've had issues with people from your country before. So, we are withdrawing the offer''. Then he wished me luck and hanged."

But the better answer is that you must teach the customer about the situation while still agreeing with them. Just agreeing with them shows weakness and the inability to have an open dialogue with a customer so that you both understand each other's perspectives."

Also I work for a competitor company, which he asked about my team and individuals target, which is very unprofessional and should never be asked especially that both of us work in the same field. That information should only be asked and given after contract signing. He bounced around all my questions, never gave me a straight answer, does not have the full structure of how the position will be setup, he was hired as \"Fractional\" CMO which also is red flag and only been at the company for 4 months. Reviews on Glassdoor were awful, 68/100 rating for the CEO witch is scary. Asked questions on how I would email or call potential prospects, which was fair, his internet kept cutting out which made the interview very frustrating, plus the interview lasted way too long as was a complete waste of time. Should have listened to the reviews before deciding to apply."
